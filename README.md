# ⚙️ PyCoGSS recipes! ⚙️

This is a collection of scripts and Jupyter notebooks that helps facilitate scalable and reproducible analysis of landscape data. 

`aoi-2-dataset.ipynb` demonstrates how to search within an area of interest (AOI) in Google Earth Engine for topographic and multispectral data in the Arctic, download that data, and convert it to a format that can be used to create labels and training data for image segmentation via [Doodleverse](https://github.com/Doodleverse) tools. For now this includes functions but in the future this tool may take the form of a package or functions/methods within a package. But for now you can run this notebook to collect your own data. Stay tuned!
